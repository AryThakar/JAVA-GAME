# 🎯 Find The Buddy Game (Java Console)

**Find The Buddy** is a simple console-based guessing game written in Java.  
Your goal is to find where "Buddy" is hiding within **3 tries** by guessing a number between **1 and 3**.

---

## 📌 How It Works
1. The game randomly selects a hiding spot for Buddy (`1`, `2`, or `3`).
2. You get **3 chances** to guess the correct number.
3. ASCII art will display, showing where Buddy might be hiding.
4. If you guess correctly, you win immediately.
5. If you use all 3 chances without finding Buddy, you lose.
